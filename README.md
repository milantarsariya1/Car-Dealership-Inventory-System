## ✨ Key Features

> [!NOTE]
> Designed to meet and exceed all core and advanced requirements of the TDD Kata specification.

### 🚗 Backend API (RESTful & Serverless Ready)
- **Security & Authorization**: Secure JWT authentication with strict Role-Based Access Control (`ADMIN` vs `USER`).
- **Full Inventory CRUD**: Comprehensive vehicle specs management (`VIN`, `make`, `model`, `category`, `price`, `quantity`, `imageUrl`, `description`).
- **Advanced Multi-Parameter Search**: Filter by make, model, category (`SEDAN`, `SUV`, `TRUCK`, `COUPE`, `EV`, `HYBRID`), and price boundaries.
- **Atomic Stock Management**:
  - `POST /api/vehicles/:id/purchase`: Decrements stock quantity safely using database transactions. Rejects when `quantity === 0`.
  - `POST /api/vehicles/:id/restock`: Atomically increases stock quantity (Admin restricted).
- **Cloud Database Integration**: Hosted on Neon Cloud PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM 6.

### 🎨 Frontend Application (React SPA + TailwindCSS)
- **Luxury Automotive Aesthetic**: Dynamic dark mode theme, glowing category badges, glassmorphism cards, and interactive micro-animations.
- **Live Inventory Tracker**: Real-time stock status (`IN STOCK` vs `OUT OF STOCK`).
- **Smart Purchase Guard**: Automatically disables the purchase button for out-of-stock vehicles.
- **Instant Order Modal**: Quantity selector and live total price calculation.
- **Admin Command Center**: Single-click vehicle management modal for adding, updating, restocking, and deleting vehicles.
- **Quick Demo Sign-In**: 1-click preset login buttons for instant testing.

## 🤖 My AI Usage & Transparency Policy

### AI Tools Utilized
- **Google DeepMind Antigravity AI**: Used as pair programmer for architecture, TDD test generation, Prisma ORM configuration, and React component design.

### How AI Was Used Throughout Development
1. **Red-Green-Refactor TDD**: AI generated failing Jest/Supertest assertion suites (**Red Phase**), followed by clean service implementations (**Green Phase**).
2. **Git Co-authorship Compliance**: All AI-assisted commits were tagged with official co-authorship trailers:
   ```text
   Co-authored-by: Antigravity Bot <antigravity-bot@users.noreply.github.com>
   ```
3. **Session Transparency**: Complete transparent logs of all prompts and AI responses are archived in [`PROMPTS.md`](./PROMPTS.md).

### AI Reflection & Impact
AI accelerated the development workflow by providing fast feedback during the TDD cycle, generating robust TypeScript type declarations, and crafting glassmorphism UI styling while ensuring full code ownership and manual verification at every step.
